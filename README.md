# The Notebook – Multi-File Markdown Editor
I chose “The Notebook – Multi-File Markdown Editor” to demonstrate frontend state management, 
real-time UI updates, and local persistence.

I used React for its component-based architecture and predictable state management and localStorage to persist data without introducing backend complexity.

# Setup steps:
npm install
npm run dev
