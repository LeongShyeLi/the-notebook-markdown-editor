# The Notebook – Multi-File Markdown Editor
I chose “The Notebook – Multi-File Markdown Editor” to demonstrate frontend state management, 
real-time UI updates, and local persistence.

I used React for its component-based architecture and predictable state management and localStorage to persist data without introducing backend complexity.

The basic flow would be User selects a file → Editor loads content → Preview updates → Changes are saved locally

# Setup steps:
npm install → npm run dev

# Challenges & Iterations
State synchronization, Performance of live preview
